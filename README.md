# Nixon's Angels Source Code

Nixon's Angels has two major components, the Unity Game Engine and the Python Webserver.

## Unity Engine
To load the unity project please use Unity to open the unity folder in this directory

## Python Webserver
The python webserver requires you to have Python 3.4 or higher installed, and to install tornado, following the instructions available here: http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/#installation

Once Python and Tornado are installed, the webserver source can be run by changing into the webserver directory and running run.py
